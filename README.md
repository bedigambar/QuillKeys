# 🖋️ QuillKeys

> *"You do not need to leave your room. Remain sitting at your table and listen. The world will freely offer itself to you to be unmasked."* — Franz Kafka

**QuillKeys** is not just another typing test. It's a journey through the profound minds of literary giants—where every keystroke echoes the philosophies of Kafka, Dostoevsky, Camus, and Gogol.
